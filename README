This repository houses various scripts/examples I have written in C that demonstrate core functionality in G-WAN.
Please see individual files in csp for comments. Other gwan resources may follow inside of this repository, as there
does not seem to be any resources/communities or even forums.

For More information about G-WAN visit http://gwan.ch
